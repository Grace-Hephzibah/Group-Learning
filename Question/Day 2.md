# Day 2

## Program 1 

Find whether the given year is a leap year or not.

### One twist:

If the year is a multiple of 100 --> like 1600,1700

Then it must have one more property. The year must be divisible by 400.

So, 
- 1600 = Leap Year
- 1700 = Not a Leap Year.

## Program 2

Find out the maximum if 10 numbers received from the input 

(Use loop)

## Program 3 

Print this pattern (Use loops)
```
0
0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0 0
```
